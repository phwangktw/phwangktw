<h2> About meâš¡:</h2>

I am currently pursuing my PhD degree in Operations Research and Industrial Engineering (ORIE) at UT-Austin. Besides the ORIE studies, I am also passionate about practical software development skills. I have experience in full-stack web development and know the core concepts of computer science such as data structure, internet, operating systems, object-oriented programming, and database management. 

Prior to my study in the U.S., I obtained my B.S./M.S. degree in chemical engineering in Taiwan and was continued serving as a process engineer in CMP module at TSMC for more than three years. 

Possessing the background spans from academic knowledge in quantitive, statistical mathematics to hands-on experiences in semiconductor production environment and programming skills, I'm eager to initiate a career as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst/Industrial Engineer or other similar job titles in semiconductor industries.
